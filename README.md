json2html
=========

A simple prototype for an idea.

Situation: I want to inject an HTML based UI into a page by loading 1 javascript file.

**Features so far:
> - js is automatically parsed and evaluated on load, so must be 1 file, ie: no secondary loading
> - needs to be small, ie: lightweight, fast to load on mobile
> - needs to be simple, ie: no convoluted template includes etc
> - must include events / allow simple application to be built

**Further requirements:
> - clean up the code
> - builder script, ie: nodeJS or similar, allowing dev to specify JSON source file
